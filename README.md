# Slate

A Markdown to HTML generator written in Ruby while participating in DUMMIES by Hack Club.

BTW., the README is generated by Ruby Bundler!

## Installation

TODO: Replace `chishgg-slate` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add chishgg-slate
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install chishgg-slate
```

## Usage

Check out slate --help for usage guide!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
